# Filepicker [dualPaneModel](https://github.com/squrki/bubbles/tree/dualPaneModel)

Adds a feature to [bubbletea](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbles). Bubbletea, written in Go, is a *terminal-based graphical user interface*. 

## Functionality

The current **bubbletea filepicker** only displays contents of a single directory at a time. The **dualPaneModel** functionality adds the ability to display both the current directory and the parent directory.

## Getting Started

To use the **dualPaneModel**, the user shall implement the **bubbletea filepicker**. However, since the **dualPaneModel** contribution wasn't merged into the master codebase, the user must import the code available on [squrki's repository](https://github.com/squrki/bubbles/tree/dualPaneModel).

## Issues

A pull request was submitted to the owners of **bubbletea**, but the pull request wasn't merged into the master codebase. There was a linting error while tests were being performed. However, the code is fully functional, and members of the coding community have noted that the **dualPaneModel** code works better than the master codebase's filepicker functionality.
