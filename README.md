# Filepicker [dualPaneModel](https://github.com/squrki/bubbles/tree/dualPaneModel)

Adds a feature to the filepicker function in [bubbletea](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbles), a *terminal-based graphical user interface* written in **go**.

## Functionality

The current **bubbletea filepicker** only displays contents of a single directory. The **dualPaneModel** functionality adds the ability to display both the current directory and the parent directory.

## Getting Started

To use the **dualPaneModel**, the user shall implement the **bubbletea filepicker**. However, since the **dualPaneModel** contribution wasn't merged into the master codebase, the user must import the code available on [squrki's repository](https://github.com/squrki/bubbles/tree/dualPaneModel).

## Issues

A pull request was submitted to the owners of **bubbletea**, but the pull request wasn't merged into the master codebase. There was a linting error during testing. However, the code is fully functional, and members of the coding community have shared the **dualPaneModel** repository as an improvement to **filepicker**.
