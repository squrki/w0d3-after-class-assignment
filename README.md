# Filepicker [dualPaneModel](https://github.com/squrki/bubbles/tree/dualPaneModel)

An added feature to the [bubbletea}(https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbles) open source repo.

## Functionality

The current bubbletea filepicker only displays contents of a single directory at a time. The dualpane functionality adds the ability to display both the current directory and the parent directory.
